### Data Extraction & Cleaning
- To get the data, used official covid19india API (Application programming interface).
1. https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/data.min.json
2. https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/timeseries.min.json
with the help of pandas and other usefull library extract the data from above API's using two methods and also clean the data set while using error handling.

- In this method created CSV file and then try to extract the data from nested dictionaries.

- In second method, directly extracted the data from API using JSON library and created small data frames and at the end joined them.
